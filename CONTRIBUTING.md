# Contributing to Cortexel

Thanks for your interest in Cortexel! This document covers how to develop, test,
and propose changes.

## Source of truth

This standalone repository is the canonical, writable source for Cortexel.
[Engram Neural Labs](https://github.com/sepahead/Paper2Brain) consumes Cortexel as a
pinned git dependency and may vendor generated contract artifacts for backend
validation; it does not own a writable Cortexel source copy.

- **Open Cortexel code PRs here.**
- After a Cortexel release, downstream consumers update their commit pins and
  generated contract snapshots in separate, reviewable changes.

## Development

```bash
bun install
bun run typecheck  # tsc --noEmit
bun run test       # vitest
bun run build      # tsup → dist/ (ESM + CJS + d.ts) + skills.manifest.json
bun run check      # typecheck + test
bun run audit
bun run lint:package
bun run test:package
```

## Design laws (non-negotiable)

These keep visualizations scientifically honest and visually consistent:

1. **A single neuron is a sphere; a population is a glowing voxel cube.**
2. **Passive data uses unlit `MeshBasic` (no emissive).** Emissive > 1.0 is
   reserved for active spike/synapse *events*. Keep emissive bloom-safe (≤ ~1.15)
   so it glows without bleaching to white.
3. **Honesty fails closed.** Provenance flags default to the conservative value;
   every currently accepted spec carries a disclosure because calibrated
   posteriors are unsupported. `calibrated_posterior:true` is rejected by every
   public gate; never add a path that suppresses, replaces, or visually reorders
   the mandatory caption. Caller notes remain explicitly unverified.
   Scene-less skills use the strict host-renderer envelope and its returned caption;
   params-only validation is not an honesty boundary.
4. **`useFrame` is allocation-free.** Reuse refs/scratch objects; never allocate
   per frame.
5. **The library stays host-agnostic; the host owns the frame.** No imports from
   any host app. Concrete scene components are injected via `renderScene`, and
   scene primitives are Canvas-less — the host owns `<Canvas>`, OrbitControls,
   bloom, background and fog; the library renders only scene *contents*.

## Pull request checklist

- [ ] `bun run check` passes
- [ ] New behavior has a test
- [ ] Design laws upheld (esp. honesty + bloom safety)
- [ ] Strict params/envelope and language-neutral manifest remain in parity
- [ ] `dist/` rebuilt and clean-room package smoke passes
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` updated under `Unreleased`
